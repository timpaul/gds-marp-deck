# Generating slide decks from Markdown
---

This whole deck has been generated automatically from [this Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timpaul/gds-marp-deck/master/PITCHME.md), using a thing called [Marp](https://marp.app/).

## How does it work?

The markdown file is hosted in [a repo on GitHub](https://github.com/timpaul/gds-marp-deck/). 
When you push changes to it, it auto-publishes the deck to [GitHub Pages](https://timpaul.github.io/gds-marp-deck/).

## What's the big deal?

- it lets authors focus on the content
- the slide design becomes very consistent
- the end results are accessible and mobile friendly
- we're not reliant on Google Slides

## Any other benefits?

Markdown is just plan text. It can be written anywhere and it's easy to generate from data.

For example, we could auto-generate decks from performance data, and re-use the same markdown to generate reports in other formats.

## What else can it do?

You can add slides notes using markdown comments.

Press 'p' to open presenter view.

<!-- Here are the slide notes for this slide -->

## Any downsides?

Yep!

- requires technical skills and confidence
- adding images and diagrams is a lot harder
- decks aren't discoverable from within Google Drive
- no collaboration features like comments

## So what could it be good for?

- Generating regular reporting decks
- For techy types who like markdown
