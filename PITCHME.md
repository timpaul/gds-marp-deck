# Generating GDS slide decks from Markdown
---

This deck has been generated from [a Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timpaul/gds-marp-deck/master/PITCHME.md), using a thing called [Marp](https://marp.app/) and a custom GDS theme.

## How does it work?

The markdown file is hosted in [a repo on GitHub](https://github.com/timpaul/gds-marp-deck/). When you push changes to it, it publishes the deck to [GitHub Pages](https://timpaul.github.io/gds-marp-deck/)

## What's the big deal?

- it lets authors focus on the content
- the slide design becomes very consistent
- the end results are accessible and mobile friendly
- it's not reliant on Google Slides

## Any other benefits?

Markdown is just plain text. It can be written anywhere and it's easy to generate from data.

We could generate decks from performance data and re-use the same markdown to generate other reports.

## What else can it do?

You can add slides notes using markdown comments.

To see them, press 'p' to open presenter view.

<!-- Here are the slide notes for this slide -->

## Any downsides?

- it requires technical skills and confidence
- adding images and diagrams is a lot harder
- decks aren't discoverable from within Google Drive
- there are no collaboration features like comments

## So what could it be good for?

- For techy types who like markdown
- For generating regular reporting decks
- Especially ones full of performance data 

## Here's the Markdown for the previous slides
