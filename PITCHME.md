# Generating slide decks from Markdown
---

This whole deck has been generated automatically from [the markdown in this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timpaul/gds-marp-deck/master/PITCHME.md), using a thing called [Marp](https://marp.app/).

## How does it work?

The markdown file is hosted on GitHub. When you push changes to it, it auto-publishes to GitHub Pages.

## What's the big deal?

This could be useful, because:

- it lets authors focus on the content
- the results are accessible and mobile friendly
- the decks will be very consistently designed
- the same markdown could be used to publish other formats
- the markdown could be generated from dynamic data

## What else can it do?

You can even add slides notes using markdown comments.

Press 'p' to open presenter view.
